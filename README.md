# Simple Linear regression using machine learning
This is a PYTHON code that uses Machine Learning to perform simple linear regression.
The data are taken from CO2 Emissions, CANADA Regression and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/calvinleighton/co2-emissions-canada-regression. 
You can change the colname_x (i.e., Engine_Size) to other features (i.e., Cylinders, ...) and perform the same analysis.
