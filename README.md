# Simple Linear regression using machine learning
This is a PYTHON code that uses Machine Learning to perform simple linear regression.
The data are taken from CO2 Emissions, CANADA Regression and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/calvinleighton/co2-emissions-canada-regression. 
You can change the colname_x (i.e., Engine_Size) to other features (i.e., Cylinders, ...) and perform the same analysis.
The code will generate 
1) Histogram plot for the selected feature. 
2) Scatter plot for the selected feature.
3) Scatter plot for train and test data for the selected feature.
4) Scatter plot for the selected feature with the regression line and R2 value.
5) Output file that contains:
   Coefficient values
   Regression Accuracy, i.e., MAE, MSE, RMSE, RAE, RSE, and R2.
